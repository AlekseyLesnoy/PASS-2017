# PASS Summit 2017

This repo contains the workshop code and decks for the Modern Web API Design session at the PASS Summit 2017.

Most of the steps are based on starting with `04-REST-Fundamentals\Src-TodoApi` then following the `README` steps in the individual folders. Copy to a new folder then apply the steps. The projects contain the "final" version of the project *after* the steps are applied.

For more clarification, read the related [REST Web API Design with ASP .NET Core 2.0](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/5-rest-api-designs-in-dot-net-core-1-29a8527e999c) blog series.
